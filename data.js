If a Blast weapon has the Knockback trait, roll a D6 for each fighter that is hit. If the result is equal to or higher than their Strength, they are knocked back as described above - however, they are moved directly away from the centre of the Blast marker instead. If the centre of the Blast marker was over the centre of their base, roll a Scatter dice to determine which way they are moved. If a Melee weapon has the Knockback trait, the attacking fighter can choose to follow the target up, moving directly towards them after they have been knocked back to remain in base contact. If the attack was made across a barricade, the attacker cannot do this. If any part of the knocked back fighter's base crosses the edge of a platform, make an Initiative test.

These are Front, Left, Right, Rear and All Round. All Round means the weapon can fire into all four arcs. Players should note that this Trait is determined by the vehicle rather than the weapon.

If it is not clear whether the attacker is within the target's Front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check - if the centre of the attacker's base is within the arc, the assault/energy shield can be used. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker.

When firing at a target outside of line of sight do not make an attack roll, instead place the 3\" Blast marker anywhere on the battlefield, then move it 2D6\" in a direction determined by the Scatter dice. If a Hit is rolled on the Scatter dice, the Blast marker does not move. At the start of the End phase of the round in which this weapon was fired, before step 1, any fighters touched by the marker are hit by the weapon. Note that this Blast marker can move through impassable terrain such as walls and may move off the battlefield. If the Blast marker does move off the battlefield, the attack will have no effect.

This can be any chem the fighter is equipped with (note that firing the weapon does not cost a dose of the chem and that friendly fighters cannot be targeted), or if the weapon also has the Toxin or Gas trait, the fighter can use these Traits instead. Instead of making a Wound roll for a Chem Delivery attack, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target's Toughness, or is a natural 6, the target is affected by the chosen chem just as if they had taken a dose. If the roll is lower than the target's Toughness, they shrug off the chem's effects."

    combi: {
      name: "Combi",
      definition: "A combi-weapon has two profiles. When it is fired, pick one of the two profiles and use it for the attack. Due to the compact nature of these weapons, they often have less capacity for ammunition, and are prone to jamming and other minor issues. When making an Ammo test for either of the weapons, roll twice and apply the worst result. However, unlike most weapons that have two profiles, ammo for the two parts of the combi-weapon are tracked separately - if one profile runs Out of Ammo, the other can still fire unless it has also run Out of Ammo."

      name: "Demolitions",
      definition: "Grenades with the Demolitions trait can be used when making close combat attacks against scenery targets (such as locked doors or scenario objectives). A fighter who uses a grenade in this way makes one attack (regardless of how many Attack dice they would normally roll), which hits automatically."

      definition: "A Digi weapon is usually worn mounted on a ring or hidden inside a glove. It can be used in addition to any other Melee weapon carried by the fighter, granting an additional close combat attack. A weapon with this Trait does not count towards the maximum number of weapons a fighter can carry. However, the maximum number of weapons with this Trait a fighter can carry is 10."

If the score is equal to or higher than the target's Strength, the target is dragged D3\" straight towards the attacker, stopping if they hit any terrain. If they move into another fighter (other than the attacker), both fighters are moved the remaining distance towards the attacker. If the weapon also has the Impale special rule and hits more than one fighter, only the last fighter to be hit can be dragged."

      name: "Firestorm (X)",
      definition: "When firing with a Firestorm weapon, a successful hit roll scores a number of hits to the model closest to the weapon equal to the number of bullet holes on the Firepower dice. In addition, the controlling player can roll more than one Firepower dice, up to the number shown in brackets (for example, when firing a Firestorm (2) weapon, up to two Firepower dice can be rolled). Make an Ammo check for each Ammo symbol that is rolled. If any of them fail, the gun runs Out of Ammo. If two or more of them fail, the gun has jammed and cannot be used for the rest of the battle."

    fixed: {
      name: "Fixed",
      definition: "A fixed weapon is not included on a fighter's card, but is instead represented by a weapon on its own base. Fixed weapons can only be moved by fighters who begin their activation in base contact with the weapon and take the Move Weapon (Double) action. This action allows a fighter to move up to their Movement characteristic and then place the weapon in base contact with themselves when they finish moving. Fighters in base contact with a fixed weapon count it as if it were a weapon on their Fighter card (i.e., they can aim, shoot and reload it as normal), provided there are no enemy fighters also in base contact with the weapon."

If a weapon has both the Flare trait and the Blast (X\") trait, after determining where the Blast marker ends up, leave it in place. In the End phase, roll a D6. On a 4+, the flare goes out and the marker is removed, otherwise it remains in play. While the Blast marker is on the battlefield, all models touched by it are Revealed."

      definition: "If a model is hit by a weapon with the Flash trait, no wound roll is made. Instead, if the target is a fighter they must make an Initiative test, and if they are a vehicle they must make a Handling test. If the test is failed, they become subject to the Blind condition. A Blind model loses their Ready marker; if they do not have a Ready marker, they do not gain a Ready marker at the start of the following round. Until the next time the model is activated, they cannot make any attacks other than Reaction attacks, for which any hit rolls will only succeed on a natural 6."

If the result is equal to or higher than the target's Toughness, or is a natural 6, make an Injury roll for them (regardless of their Wounds characteristic). Otherwise, they shrug off the effects of the gas. No save roll can be made against a weapon with this Trait. When a vehicle is hit by an attack made by a weapon with the Gas trait a wound roll is not made. Instead, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or higher than the target's rear Toughness, or is a natural 6, they suffer a Driver Wounded result on the Crew Damage table.

After the weapon has been fired, leave the Blast marker in place. For the remainder of the round, any model moving through this area will use 2\" of their Movement for every 1\" they move (note this affects all vehicles regardless of their Locomotive special rule). Remove the Blast marker during the End phase."

      definition: "Despite being Wargear, grenades are treated as a special type of ranged weapon. A fighter equipped with grenades can throw one as a Shoot (Basic) action. Grenades do not have a Short range, and their Long range is determined by multiplying the fighter's Strength by the amount shown. A fighter can only carry a limited number of grenades. The Firepower dice does not need to be rolled when attacking with a grenade. Instead, after the attack has been resolved, it is assumed that the Ammo symbol has been rolled and an Ammo test is made automatically. If this is failed, grenades cannot be reloaded; the fighter has run out of that type of grenade and cannot use them for the remainder of the battle."

Gunked fighters reduce their Movement characteristic by 1 to a minimum of 1 and don't add D3\" to their movement when making a Charge action. In addition, they subtract 1 from the dice roll when making an Initiative check. Gunked fighters are also more flammable and catch fire on a 2+, rather than a 4+, when hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait. The Gunked condition lasts until the End phase or until the fighter catches fire after being hit by a weapon with the Blaze Trait."

        Resources: Each Gunk tank is worth D6 Power or D6 Sustenance <br/><br/> \
        <b>The Gunk Tank</b> Central to the fight is the Gunk Tank, with both sides trying to siphon off as much precious gunk as they can while stopping their opponent from doing the same. The Gunk Tank can be represented by any suitable large container (ideally at least 3\" in diameter) <br/><br/>\
        In addition to the standard rules for a Gunk Tank (see page 50), a fighter in base contact with the Gunk Tank can make the Siphon (Double) action. If successful, place a gunk token on their Fighter card or next to their model to show they are in possession of precious gunk. A fighter can only carry one gunk token at a time, and if Seriously Injured or taken Out of Action will drop their gunk token (place the token next to the downed fighter or where they were before they are removed from the battlefield). <br/><br/>\
        <b>Lugging Gunk</b><br/>Carrying gunk is not without its dangers. A fighter carrying a gunk token is more flammable and if hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait is automatically set on fire without the need to roll (note this does not cause them to drop their gunk token). <br/><br/> \
        The purpose of gunk is to escape with it, and any fighter carrying a gunk token may be removed from the battlefield by moving into base contact with any battlefield edge. Fighters removed in this way do not count as either Seriously Injured or Out of Action for the purposes of Bottle tests. <br/><br/> \
        If one gang forces the other gang to flee or takes all of their fighters Out of Action, they add D3 gunk tokens to their total before ending the battle. <br/>"

Next, players take turns placing defences (see Outlander Terrain) anywhere on the battlefield (these can include minefields), until six defences have been placed.
